## Contributing

[There are plenty of opportunities to get involved](https://github.com/lakshyakumar/enthalpy/issues). Pick an outstanding task, let us know what you are working on and fire away with any questions.

The package is made up of 2 main folders:

- /src contains all the Enthalpy React components
- /example is our [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) based demo application

To setup and run a local copy:

1.  Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/lakshyakumar/enthalpy`
2.  Run `npm install` in the root folder
3.  Run `npm install` in the example folder
4.  In separate terminal windows, run `npm start` in the root and example folders.
5.  In separate terminal run `npm run styleguide` to get the styleguidist up and running on `localhost:6060`

You should now be up and running with live browser reloading of the example website while you work on Enthalpy React components in the /src folder.

When you're done working on your changes, submit a PR with the details and include a screenshot if you've changed anything visually.
